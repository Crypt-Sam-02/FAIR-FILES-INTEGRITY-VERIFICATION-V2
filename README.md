MCA Final Year Project - based on integrity verification of files and ensuring the authenticity of the files used in programs.

Overview: This project provides a robust file integrity verification and threat analysis solution. It was developed using Go for backend performance and TypeScript for an interactive front end. It ensures that critical files remain secure by detecting unauthorized modifications and analyzing potential threats.

Features File Integrity Verification

Uses cryptographic hash functions (SHA-256, SHA-512) to detect unauthorized changes.
Supports both real-time and scheduled checks.
Threat Analysis

Identifies threats based on integrity violations.
Categorizes risks and provides actionable insights.
Web-Based Dashboard

Built with TypeScript for an interactive user experience.
View integrity reports, analyze threats, and scan results.
Technology Stack Backend: Go (Golang) for efficient file integrity and threat analysis operations. Frontend: TypeScript (React/Next.js and Flutter) for a dynamic user interface. Database: SQLite for storing logs and configuration data. API: RESTFul API for communication between the frontend and backend.

Use Cases Enterprise Security: Ensure data integrity and meet regulatory compliance. Software Verification: Validate distributed binaries and configuration files. Incident Response: Quickly identify unauthorized changes for proactive security measures. DevOps Monitoring: Keep configuration files and deployment scripts secure.

Installation - Prerequisites Go 1.20+ Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn, Dart and Flutter (for the frontend) Database (SQLite, for persistent storage)

Configuration The config.yaml file (backend) and .env file (frontend) allow customization:

Backend (config.yaml) Directories to Monitor Hash Algorithms (SHA-256, SHA-512) Alert Settings (email/webhook)

Frontend (.env) RestFul API Notification Preferences

Roadmap Add support for machine learning-based anomaly detection. Enhance the dashboard with real-time analytics and visualizations. Add support for real-time monitoring analysis.
